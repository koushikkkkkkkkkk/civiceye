const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Do I need an account to report an issue?",
    answer: "Yes, you need to sign in with your campus credentials. This helps us prevent spam and allows us to update you on the status of your report."
  },
  {
    question: "What kinds of issues can I report?",
    answer: "You can report anything from broken lights, plumbing leaks, and Wi-Fi dead zones, to structural damage and safety hazards on campus."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take for an issue to get fixed?",
    answer: "Response times vary by department and severity. Critical safety hazards are prioritized immediately, while routine maintenance usually takes 2-3 business days."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I be notified when my report is resolved?",
    answer: "Yes. You will receive an automated notification as soon as the maintenance team marks your reported issue as resolved."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I see what others have reported?",
    answer: "Yes, the campus map and feed show all public reports. This prevents duplicate submissions and keeps the community informed."
  },
  {
    question: "What if an issue is an emergency?",
    answer: "For immediate emergencies (e.g., major flooding, fire, severe security threats), please call campus security directly instead of using the app."
